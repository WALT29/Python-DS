# STRING

# defined either in single or double quotes
# you can also use the inbuilt string constructor str()
#          str("I am a string") - though this is not common

dog_name="Miles" # miles is the string
print(dog_name)

#using strings together with variables use f string f"${varible_name}"
price_1="2.5"

print(price_1)
